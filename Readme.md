# TypeScript: Object-Oriented Programming App

This is a console application, it will be always execute from terminal, 
you should find a menu with the options to implement all the requirements

In this TypeScript exercise we applied OOP fundamentals in order
to build an app to manage a series of conferences about different topics, 
we have some conditions to consider each conference:

- There will be a mentor and 20 participants max.
- You should know the starting and ending date
- The students and mentors need name and email at least

  
### Functionalities

to ensure is the owner of the event
- A mentor can give a conference if he has the schedule available, please
consider only the day related to the date
- The students can register for any conference they want, consider the 
maximum capacity
- A person should have been registered as a student previously to  be able to 
register on a conference
